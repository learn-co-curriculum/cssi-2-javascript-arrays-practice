# Arrays  in JavaScript


##Instructions:

###1. Arrays:

*  Arrays are list-like objects, simmilar to a bookshelf that has slots to store different books (elements) in a single shelf. Books can be fetched by identifying their (index) shelf position.
*  Declaring an empty array using the Array constructor.
```javascript
var myArr = new Array();
```
*  Arrays are filled with elements:
```javascript
var myArr2 = [element, anotherElement];
```
*  Elements can be strings, numbers, or boolean. If you leave a blank spot in an array it creates a blank shelf space (null) placeholder. Keeping these characteristics in mind, make a new array, "myArr", with four elements that will behave in the following ways:
```javascript
myArr[0]
  --> 'Hello'
myArr[1]
  --> undefined
myArr[2]
  --> 54.3
myArr[3]
  --> true
```
*  We can insert new values into any space in the array using the positions index. Change the undefined item in "myArr" to equal the string "Stuff" instead.


###2. Overwriting:
*  We can overwrite all the elements of an array simply by giving the array new values. Or passing one array into another.
*  Make an array called "fruits" where the four elements are these strings: Apples, Oranges, Pears, and Bananas.
*  Overwrite "myArr" to equal "fruits".

###3. Retrieving the Total Number of Elements and Last Index:
*  Call length on the myArr. Is the result the number you were expecting?
*  Keeping in mind the fact that indexes start with zero instead of one, get the last element's index position in "myArr".
*  Make a variable "pos" and set it equal to the number you found in the step just above.
*  What should myArr[pos] return? Does it?

###4. Array Insertion and Deletion:
*  We can insert on to the end of an Array simply by using the push method.
*  Insert the string "Strawberries" into "myArr".
*  You can pull the last element off the end using the pop method.
*  Call pop on "myArr". What will myArr[myArr.length - 1] return? Does it?
*  We can use [splice](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_splice.asp) method to insert content at a given position or to remove content from a given position. Here is the syntax:
```javascript
arrayToModify.splice(index, how many elements to remove, optional content to add);
```
*  Add the string "Tiger" at index 2 without removing any elements. What do you think myArr.length; will return?
*  Let's say we needed to remove the second to last item, but we do not know how long the array is...We can use negative numbers to go to end of array and index from end to beginning.
*  Replace "Pears" with "Lion" using the negative index number, using the info above.
*  Now remove Lion from the 3rd index position using splice.
